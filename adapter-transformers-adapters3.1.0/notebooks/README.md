# AdapterHub Notebooks

Here you can find a collection of notebooks for AdapterHub and the adapter-transformers library.

The table shows notebooks provided by AdapterHub and contained in this folder that show the different possibilities of working with adapters.

As adapter-transformers is fully compatible with HuggingFace's Transformers, you can also use the large collection of official and community notebooks there: [ðŸ¤— Transformers Notebooks](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/notebooks).
