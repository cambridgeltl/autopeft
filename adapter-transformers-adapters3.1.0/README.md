A friendly fork of HuggingFace's <i>Transformers</i>, adding Adapters to PyTorch language models
</h3>

![Tests](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers.svg?color=blue)](https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers/blob/master/LICENSE)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/adapter-transformers)](https://pypi.org/project/adapter-transformers/)

`adapter-transformers` is an extension of [HuggingFace's Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, integrating adapters into state-of-the-art language models by incorporating **[AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml)**, a central repository for pre-trained adapter modules.

_ðŸ’¡ Important: This library can be used as a drop-in replacement for HuggingFace Transformers and regularly synchronizes new upstream changes.
Thus, most files in this repository are direct copies from the HuggingFace Transformers source, modified only with changes required for the adapter implementations._

## Installation

`adapter-transformers` currently supports **Python 3.7+** and **PyTorch 1.3.1+**.
After [installing PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), you can install `adapter-transformers` from PyPI ...

```
pip install -U adapter-transformers
```

... or from source by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers.git
cd adapter-transformers
pip install .
```

## Getting Started

HuggingFace's great documentation on getting started with _Transformers_ can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html). `adapter-transformers` is fully compatible with _Transformers_.

To get started with adapters, refer to these locations:

- **[Colab notebook tutorials](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers/tree/master/notebooks)**, a series notebooks providing an introduction to all the main concepts of (adapter-)transformers and AdapterHub
- **https://docs.adapterhub.ml**, our documentation on training and using adapters with _adapter-transformers_
- **https://adapterhub.ml** to explore available pre-trained adapter modules and share your own adapters
- **[Examples folder](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch)** of this repository containing HuggingFace's example training scripts, many adapted for training adapters
