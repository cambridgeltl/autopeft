Auto Classes
============

Similar to the ``AutoModel`` classes built-in into HuggingFace Transformers, adapter-transformers provides an ``AutoAdapterModel`` class.
As with other auto classes, the correct adapter model class is automatically instantiated based on the pre-trained model passed to the ``from_pretrained()`` method.
